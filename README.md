# AoC

My AoC solutions in Rust, using the `cargo-aoc` crate.

The repo is divided into separate crates for each year (_not_ a Rust workspace as they are currently incompatible with `cargo-aoc`).

To run the exercises, `cd` into each `aoc*` directory and run:

```bash
cargo aoc
# To run tests:
cargo test
```
